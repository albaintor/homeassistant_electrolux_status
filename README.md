## Prerequisites

All devices need configured and Alias set in the Electrolux app prior to configuration.
If this does not occur the home assistant integration may raise an authentication error depending on device type and region such as:

- My Electrolux Care/My AEG Care (EMEA region)
- Electrolux Kitchen/AEG Kitchen (EMEA region)
- Electrolux Life (APAC region)
- Electrolux Home+ (LATAM region)
- Electrolux Oven/Frigidaire 2.0 (NA region)

## Installation

_If the integration does not appear add a new repository in HACS manually: `https://github.com/albaintor/homeassistant_electrolux_status`_

1. Search for `Electrolux Status` in HACS.
2. Click install.
3. In the HA UI go to `Configuration` -> `Integrations` and search for `Electrolux Status`.
4. Insert your Electrolux credentials ( You can test the credentials in https://developer.electrolux.one/login)

**Known issues :**

- This integration is based on new APIs and may be unstable
- Some commands don't work (to be investigated) : several dropdown lists like setting analog temperature...
- Upstream API does not currently support `language`
- Issues with authentication, if the integration can't start and you see a "403 forbidden" error in the logs, there is a workaround : try to login to the website of your appliance (eg aeg.fr, aeg.nl, electrolux...) with the account and password from the app. If the website reports that the password is wrong : change it using "forgot password" link and try again to configure the integration

Maybe changing the password through the aeg-website into your app-password can help you as well?
